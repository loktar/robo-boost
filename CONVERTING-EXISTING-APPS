ALTERING YOUR EXISTING APPLICATION -- WORK IN PROGRESS


Before you open IntelliJ:

    - Add the Robolectric (droid-sugar) git submodule to your application. (You'll probably want to fork the droid-sugar
    repository so you can make changes, and hopefully you'll contribute your improvements back!)
    In the root of your application run:

     git submodule add git@github.com:pivotal/droid-sugar.git

- Reorganize your project.  From the root of your project:

    mkdir -p code aidls/src

    mv src gen code

        - find all *.aidl under code and move under aidls/src directory. If you don't have any aidl's in your project,
        you'll probably want to add a dummy text file in the aidls/src directory so that the directories are not auto
        deleted by IntelliJ.


    mkdir -p code/lib/main

        - place your project's production jars in this directory (I.E. roboguice jar)

    mkdir -p code/lib/test

         - place your project's test jars in this directory (I.E. junit jar)


- add the following to the build.properties in the root of your project:

        source.dir=code/src
        test.dir=code/test
        aidl.dir=aidls/src
        tmp.dir=tmp

        external.libs.dir=code/lib/main

- Open IntelliJ [this section is not correct/complete]

    Go to Module Setup

    Select Code module -> Dependencies -> Add -> Library -> Global Library... -> Android x.x
        set the scope to: Complile

    Select Code module -> Dependencies -> Add -> Library -> Module Library -> jar directory -> choose 'code/lib/test'
        set the scope to: Test


    Select (main project module) -> Android facet
    Select (*) Generate Java files under other source root: [ .../code/gen ]

    Select (main module) -> Dependencies
    Add -> Module dependency -> Code
    Add -> Module dependency -> Aidls

    Create new module -> use existing iml with droid-sugar/droid-sugar.iml.
    Select Code module -> Dependencies
    Add -> Module dependency -> droid-sugar
    Change scope from Compile to Test
